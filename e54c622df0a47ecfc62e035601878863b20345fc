      "message": "Hmm, actually this module has always enabled \u0027:all\u0027 from autodie, see its import method. So I need to add it too to the Depends line. And I don\u0027t think it would be safe at this point in time to stop doing that as current code executing system/exec might then not die correctly. So if we want to disable this and change \u0027:all\u0027 to \u0027:default\u0027 we\u0027d need to audit the users and prepare a transition. Which seems out of scope for this specific change.\n\nI also notice that ngcp-panel is depending on libautodie-perl and libipc-system-perl which it should in principle not, as those are transitive dependencies from the libsipwise-base-perl, and should be depended by the latter only.",
