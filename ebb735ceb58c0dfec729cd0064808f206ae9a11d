      "message": "I see, that package didn\u0027t appear in my searches.\n\n/usr/share/bash feels like hijacking the namespace of the back package, somewhere where they could ship default files (e.g. bashrc/profile) if it was not historically done in /etc directly.  In the case of /usr/share I\u0027d use the package name, \"sipwise-base\", or something similar.\n\nI just noticed that systemd puts stuff in /lib/systemd which are not shared libraries but \"system services\", there are also the pkgconfig files, and probably other stuff which is not shared libraries -- in that respect, these files of libsipwise-base-bash are more shared libraries than those, in concept.\n\nAnyway, just bikeshedding, I gave you already +2 because :)",
